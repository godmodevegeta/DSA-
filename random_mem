Sure, here's the information divided into points:

1. Evaluation of Packages: Several packages were tested, including Obigraph, Scalene, memory_profiler, and pympler.

2. Identifying the Issue: It was established that when pandas objects are executed with the flask server, a documented leak occurs.

3. Suspected Cause: The investigation led to the suspicion that a dataframe object might be the root cause of the leak.

4. Replication Attempt: To replicate the leak, the flask server was run on a local machine. Instead of making API calls to the actual pods, it was connected to the database and used in this scenario.

5. Successful Capture: The Psutils module effectively captured the observed leak during the replication attempt.
